# BugBuster
Generative modeling for novel insecticides

# Instructions
Several Jupyter notebooks are available for demonstration and illustration. 
For a high-level overview of the general workflow of the project: refer to `run-end-to-end.ipynb` in the top-level directory. 
For more detailed explanation of preprocessing/postprocessing and each of the modules that are involved, refer to the notebooks in the `example-notebooks` directory. 
No pretrained models are used, and detailed explanation on how the datasets that were used are provided. 

# Dependencies
Refer to `project_env.yaml` for a list of dependencies.
